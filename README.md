# ft_linear_regression
The aim of this project is to introduce us to the basic concept behind machine learning. For this project, we will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.

## 1. Getting the datas

First, we get the data form the csv file, that we store in a list of lists

## 2. The model

The linear regression is used to find a linear relationship between a dependant variable (here the mileage of the car) and an independant variable (the price of the car). Since it gives us a line, it will be defined as:
	f(x) = a.x + b

## The cost function
